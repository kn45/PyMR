# PyMR
PyMR is a small python wrapper for map-reduce programming in hadoop streaming mode. It emulates many operations as Java MR framework. One can simply override map() or reduce() method to make code running in streaming mode.

## Features
Never bother with input, group by key, which have been handled by PyMR. Just override such method:  

- Mapper:  
  \_setup(self), \_map(self, inl), \_cleanup(self)
- Reducer:  
  \_setup(self), \_reduce(self, key, values), \_cleanup(self)  
  self.delim, self.key\_fields

## Example
`cat test_in | python test.py m | sort | python test.py r`

## Todo
Lots. Add more functions such as counter, env\_getter etc.
